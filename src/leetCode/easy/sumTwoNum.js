// Why is this not a good solution?
// Typically, brute force solutions are easy to implement, and will always find
// a solution if one exist. But the tradeoff tends to be that they are computationally expensive,
//  and may only even be implementable if we know that the size of the inputs are relatively small.
// This algorithm can take a LONG time. In fact, in Big O notation, it’s quadratic, or O(n) squared time because,
//  at worse case, we’d have to look at every single element of this array and do an operation of every other element of the array.
// A nested loop tends to be a sign of optimization opportunities. So, how can we make it better?

// every algorithm has a trade off. A more efficient solution in terms of time, has the tradeoff that,
// a) It requires more memory (i.e. space)
// b) It’s a bit harder to conceptualize
// this approach takes each number, and looks for the number which when added to itself,
// would equalize the target (i.e the complement). For each number in the array, it creates this complement variable.
// If that complement number exists in the key:value object called numObj we created (i.e, it’s not undefined),
//  then great! Return that number’s position in the object along with the position of number we’re looking at,
